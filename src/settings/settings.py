# Code by S. BÃ¤r - April 2023
#----------------------------------------
# SETTINGS AND THEIR PURPOSE:
#   
#   SCRIPT SETTINGS:
#   ================
#   script_api_version  -> Used to check compatibility of the script with the installed Metashape version
#       
#   LOG SETTINGS:
#   ============
#   log_output_folder_path -> Path where the log files should be stored
#
#   DATASET STRUCTURE SETTINGS:
#   ==========================
#   use_folder_prefix   -> Used if you want to select datasets with a certain prefix only
#   folder_prefixes     -> Dataset prefixes that are accepted
#   model_folder_path   -> Location of the model folder (relative to dataset folder)
#   image_folder_path   -> Location of the image folder (relative to dataset folder)
#   image_extensions    -> Image types that are used eg. png, jpeg, etc.
#   cam_pos_file_path   -> Location of the cam position file (relative to dataset folder)
#   scan_info_file_path -> Location of the scan information file (relative to dataset folder)
#
#   SCAN INFORMATION REGEX SETTINGS:
#   ===============================
#   f_number_regex   -> Regex used to extract the f-number
#   num_images_regex -> Regex used to extract the number of needed images
#
#   INPUT OUTPUT FOLDER SETTINGS:
#   ============================
#   calculation_input_folder_path   -> Location of the 1_SCANNED folder (absolute path)
#   calculation_output_folder_path  -> Location of the 2_CALCULATED folder (absolute path)
#   export_input_folder_path        -> Location of the 3_UNPINNED folder (absolute path)
#   export_output_folder_path       -> Location of the 4_EXPORTED folder (absolute path)
#
#   # CALCULATION SETTINGS:
#   use_tweaks          -> Wether to use tweaks or not during the calculation. If you dont want to use tweaks just set it to False
#   tweaks              -> List of tweaks that are used to calculate the model. If you dont want to use tweaks just set use_tweaks to False
#   depthmap_downscale  -> Downscale factor of the depthmaps (0 = no downscale, 0 < = more down scaled)
#   use_smooth          -> Whether to smooth the calculated mesh or not
#
#   EXPORT SETTINGS: 
#   ===============
#   image_texture_size -> Size of the exported texture (width and height are the same)
